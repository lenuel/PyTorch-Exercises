You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Recomend installing  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

## Projects:

### 1. Cat-Dog-Classifier  
- The machine learning model was trained on  a set of labeled images of  cats and dogs, was saved and used  to classify a new image as cats or dogs. The original data set can be downloaded [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip).

- Google Colaboratory is used in order to be able to train model using GPU.
- pretrained model file "resnet50_1epoch.pth".
- fie for demonstration "Aza1.jpg"
